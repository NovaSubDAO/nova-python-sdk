# Nova SDKs

**Nova** is a new Maker actor whose goal is to explore new ( “nova” ) market segments for the Maker Ecosystem.

Our initial target is on crypto newcomers / beginners across Emerging Markets, ie. those users who are NOT DeFi native and bring them easy access to Maker offerings such as our savings rate and upcoming token farms.

We believe this is best achieved through a B2B model and we provide SDKs to enable an easy and rapid integration for our distribution partners.

We currently support Go SDK. Please find its technical documentation in the left bar.
